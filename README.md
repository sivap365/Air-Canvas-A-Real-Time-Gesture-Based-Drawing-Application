Air Canvas - A Touch-Free Drawing Application

🧠 Description:
Air Canvas is a computer vision-based application that enables users to draw on a virtual canvas using only hand gestures. It uses the webcam feed to detect hand movements in real time, allowing users to draw, erase, and change colors without touching any input device. The system is built using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.

🎯 Objective:
To provide a natural and touch-free drawing experience using real-time hand gesture recognition.

🔧 Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- MediaPipe
- NumPy

📂 File Included:
- mv code-1.exe → Executable file of the Air Canvas application.

▶️ How to Use:
1. Double-click on `mv code-1.exe` to launch the application.
2. Ensure your webcam is connected and functioning.
3. Hold any blue colour object in your hand in front of your webcam to draw.
